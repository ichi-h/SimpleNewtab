# Simple Newtab
This extension can customize the new tab page simply.

I recently started using Brave browser, but it's new tab page was not quite.  
I like some simple new tab page like Chrome browser, so I created this extension.  

I developed it with Next.js framework, but I think the choice was wrong.  
That means the packaged file size of the Next.js application is over 6 MB that is huge in this kind of extensions.  

Through this development, I felt using Next.js for a small project is like fastening 1 sheet of paper by spear.
